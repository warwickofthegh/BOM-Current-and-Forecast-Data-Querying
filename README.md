I wanted to display some current and forecast weather data on my home website which I use to display monitoring graphs and controls for home automation. I looked at other sources of this data with full documented APIs but I just see to many variances in the weather data and really wanted to go straight to the source being the Australian BOM data.

## Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) Data Feeds
JSON Weather Feeds for cities and towns - http://www.rogerclark.net/json-data-from-www-bom-gov-au-a-work-in-progress/
XML Forecast Feeds for cities and towns - http://www.bom.gov.au/catalogue/data-feeds.shtml
